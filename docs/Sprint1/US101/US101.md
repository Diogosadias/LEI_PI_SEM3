# US101 - Import Ships from File to BST

# Analysis

*This section of the document express the work done in the Analysis part of the US.*

### 1. User Story Description

*As a traffic manager, I which to import ships from a text file into a BST.*

### 2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

In this US the client wants to have the Traffic Manager providing a csv file and put info into a BST. This US cares only with the creation of the Tree Structure and does not concern with the insertion or deletion of information, **besides the file.** 

Access to Application - Client does not have idea yet - Maybe Email/User Name and password.

There's information missing from the Excel file. Client hasn't answered it yet.

Client has not specified yet what is the sorting criteria - What is the attribute that should be used in the compareTo or comparable.

Client specified that firstly we should import small ships and next big ships.
### 3. Acceptance Criteria

AC(ESINF):
* No data Lost

### 4. Found out Dependencies

No dependencies found.

### 5 Input and Output Data

####Input:
* csv file - with attributes of ship


####Output:
* Information that the operation was successful 

### 6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 7. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 8. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## Design 

### 1. Rationale (optional)

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1 - Import Ships	 |				Interact with User?		 |    ImportUI         |    Class that interacts with User                          |
| Step 2 - ask file name/location 		 |			Ask for information	?			 |   ImportUI          |    Class that interacts with User                          |
| Step 3 - types file name/location 		 |			get name/location?				 |      ImportController       | Bridges between UI and System                             |
| Step 3 - types file name/location 		 |			read information from file?				 |      Import       |   Operation is related with the Class                           |
| Step 3 - types file name/location 		 |			assure validity?				 |     Ship        |    IE : This class knows its own creation rules                          |
| Step 3 - types file name/location 		 |			create Ship?				 |    ImportController         |    IE: Knows who to call                      |
| Step 3 - types file name/location 		 |			store Ship?				 |    ShipsTree         |       Store in a efficient way the information needed                       |
| Step 4 - informs operation success 		 |			inform operation success?				 |    ImportUI         |        Class that interacts with User                        |


#### 1.1 Systematization 

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Ship
* ShipMovement
* TrafficManager



Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * ImportUI  
 * ImportController
* Import
* ShipsTree

### 2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

### 3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

### 4. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
