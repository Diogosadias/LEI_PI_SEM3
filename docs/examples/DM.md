## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes ##
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development". 


### _Conceptual Class Category List_ ###

| **Category** 		|  **Candidate Classes** |
|------------  				|---------      |
| **Business Transactions** 	| |
|**Transaction Line Items**| |
|**Product/Service related to a Transaction or Transaction Line Item**| |
|**Transaction Records**|  |
|**Roles of People or Organizations**||
|**Places**||
|**Noteworthy Events**||
|**Physical Objects**| |
|**Descriptions of Things**| |
|**Organizations**||
|**Other External/Collaborating Systems**| |
|**Records of finance, work, contracts, legal matters**||
|**Documents mentioned/used to perform some work**| |




### **Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes**






| Concept (A) 		|  Association   	|  Concept (B) |
|----------	   		|:-------------:		|------:       |
