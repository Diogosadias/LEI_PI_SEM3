# US 201 - From File to 2d-Tree

# Analysis

*This section of the document express the work done in the Analysis part of the US.*

### 1. User Story Description

*As a Port manager, I which to import ports from a text file and create a 2D-tree with port locations*

### 2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

2D-Tree is a Data Structure. In this case it will be use with the location of which port (Latitude and Longitude)

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

AC:
* 2D-tree balanced.


### 4. Found out Dependencies

No dependencies found

### 5 Input and Output Data

Input :
* Text File with information

Output:
* Operation success

### 6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 7. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 8. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## Design 

### 1. Rationale (optional)

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              

#### 1.1 Systematization 

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

### 2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

### 3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

### 4. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
