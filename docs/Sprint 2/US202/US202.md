# US 202 - Find The Nearest Port

# Analysis

*This section of the document express the work done in the Analysis part of the US.*

### 1. User Story Description

*As a Traffic manager, I which to find the closest port of a ship given its CallSign,
on a certain DateTime*

### 2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

2D-Tree is a Data Structure.The Ship will be identified from the CallSign and we most retrieve is Location fronm the Date Given

Client hasn't answered yet if Date doesn't correspond what should we do, if calculate mean or get last or next.

Then we most us the properties of 2D-Tree to find the nearest location.

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

AC:
* using 2D-tree to find closest port.


### 4. Found out Dependencies

US101 needs to be Implemented - Ships most be imported
US201 - Needs to be Implemented - Ports most be imported.
### 5 Input and Output Data

Input :
* Ship - CallSign
* Ship - DateTime

Output:
* Nearest Port

### 6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 7. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 8. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## Design 

### 1. Rationale (optional)

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              

#### 1.1 Systematization 

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

### 2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

### 3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

### 4. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
