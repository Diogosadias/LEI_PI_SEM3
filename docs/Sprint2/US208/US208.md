# US 208 - Calculate the occupancy rate of a given ship for a given cargo manifest

# Analysis

*This section of the document express the work done in the Analysis part of the US.*

### 1. User Story Description

*As Ship Captain, I want to know the occupancy rate (percentage) of a given ship
for a given cargo manifest. Occupancy rate is the ratio between total number of containers
in the ship coming from a given manifest and the total capacity of the ship, i.e., the
maximum number of containers the ship can load.*

### 2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 



### 3. Acceptance Criteria

AC:
* Ship and cargo manifest are correctly identified.
* Occupancy rate is properly computed.


### 4. Found out Dependencies

US203 - review 

### 5 Input and Output Data

Input :
* Ship - mmsi
* Cargo Manifest - id 

Output:
* occupancy rate

### 6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 7. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 8. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## Design 

### 1. Rationale (optional)

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              

#### 1.1 Systematization 

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

### 2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

### 3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

### 4. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
