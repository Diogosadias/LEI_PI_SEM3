# US403 - Find the Most Efficient Circuit Given a Start Location

# Analysis

*This section of the document express the work done in the Analysis part of the US.*

### 1. User Story Description

*As a Traffic manager I wish to know the most efficient circuit that starts from a
source location and visits the greatest number of other locations once, returning to the
starting location and with the shortest total distance*

### 2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

Using one of the Algorithms provided, for a given start location find the most efficient circuit

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

AC(ESINF):
* Implement one of the heuristics used for this type of circuit.

### 4. Found out Dependencies

Needs to have Graph built - US301.


### 5 Input and Output Data

####Input:
* Start Location


####Output:
* Information about the Circuit 

### 6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 7. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 8. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## Design 

### 1. Rationale (optional)

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| 	 |						 |             |                             |
|  		 |				 |             |                             |

#### 1.1 Systematization 

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * 



Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * XXXUI  
 * 

### 2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

### 3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

### 4. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
